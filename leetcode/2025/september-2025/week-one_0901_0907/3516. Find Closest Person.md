# 3516. Find Closest Person

# Solution Submissions
1. [Solution Submission One](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/submissions/1759312217)
2. [Solution Submission Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/submissions/1759334298)
## Problem Description
###### [3516. Find Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/)
- You are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the positions of three people on a number line:
	- `x` is the position of Person 1.
	- `y` is the position of Person 2.
	- `z` is the position of Person 3, who does **not** move.
- Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the **same** speed.

- Determine which person reaches Person 3 **first**:
	- Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
	- Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
	- Return 0 if both arrive at the **same** time.

## Return the result accordingly.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 2, y = 7, z = 4

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
- Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.

Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 2, y = 5, z = 6

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4 steps.
- Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.

Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 1, y = 5, z = 3

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

- Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2 steps.
- Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.

Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= x, y, z <= 100`



## Answer

```javascript
/**

* @param {number} x

* @param {number} y

* @param {number} z

* @return {number}

*/

var findClosest = function(x, y, z) {

	const xLength = Math.abs(x - z);

	const yLength = Math.abs(y - z);

	if (xLength < yLength) {

		return 1;

	} else if (xLength > yLength) {

		return 2;

	} else {

		return 0;

	}

};
```


# [3516. Editorial Notes](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/editorial)
### Approach: Mathematics

#### Intuition

We are asked to determine which of the first two people reaches the third person first, given that they all move at the same speed. Since speed is identical, the deciding factor is distance: the person closer to the third person will arrive sooner.

Let the distance between the first and third person be

dxz​=∣x−z∣

and the distance between the second and third person be

dyz​=∣y−z∣

Now we simply compare these distances:

- If dxz​<dyz​, then the first person is closer, so we return `1`.
- If dxz​>dyz​, then the second person is closer, so we return `2`.
- Otherwise, both are equally close, so we return `0`.

This reduces the problem to a straightforward comparison of absolute differences.

#### Implementation

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(1).
    
- Space complexity: O(1).
