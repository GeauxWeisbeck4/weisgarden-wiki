# Thursday | 2025-09-04 | [[sprint-29|Sprint 29]]

-  Today is going to be a good day. We are going to meet with our heart counselor/advisor person, Jenette at 11:30 today and hopefully that goes well. She said she should be able to get us started on the Rapid Rehousing program, something we didn't know was possible! So we'll see how it goes! First NFL games tonight, a beautiful morning, and its going to be an incredible day!
